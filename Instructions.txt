This programming exercise contains three files:

1.  Instructions.txt - This document.
2.  928-08122010334.txt - This is a standard automotive inspection file sent to 
                          Vascor by a partner.
3.  VASCOR Ltd 928 Spec V2-4.doc - This is a specification document to tell you 
                                   how to read the inspection file and what 
                                   data elements are included.

This programming exercise is a very realistic scenario of something this job 
will require on a day to day basis.  In the file 928-08122010334.txt the 
segments are delimited by new lines (CRLF) and the elements are delimited by 
*.

Your task is to create a simple C# application (can be a simple console 
application) that does the following:

1.  Reads the 928-08122010334.txt file 
2.  Outputs the following data for each vehicle in the file (each unique 
    Vehicle Identification Number) on a separate line, delimited by spaces:
        - Vehicle Identification Number
        - Inspection Date
        - Standard Carrier Alpha Code (Transportation Carrier)
        - The first Damage Area Code noted for the vehicle.
        - The first Damage Area Type noted for the vehicle.
        - The first Damage Severity Code noted for the vehicle.

Output lines should look something like this (example is not from the 
included file):
1GT499E77LF280521 20200811 NS   36 34 1
